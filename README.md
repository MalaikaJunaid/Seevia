**Seevia** is a multimodal AI ecosystem designed to empower visually impaired individuals through structured scene understanding and adaptive indoor navigation. By bridging the gap between Computer Vision and Sequential Decision Making, Seevia provides a "voice-first" interface to manage personal inventory and navigate dynamic retail environments.

## 🏗️ System Dimensions

### 1. Personal Inventory & Autonomous Shopping
A closed-loop system for managing household essentials and optimizing the shopping experience.
* **Pantry Manager:** Uses predictive modeling to track usage frequency and expiry.
* **Shopping Assistant:** Employs **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to optimize navigation paths in unmapped store layouts.

### 2. Assistive Perception Engine
A real-time sensory layer focused on environment interpretation and user safety.
* **Scene Understanding:** **CNN-based** object detection and specialized **OCR** for product identification.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Sensor-fusion AI to detect falls, disorientation, or unusual inactivity.
